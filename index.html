        <p>With us, you won’t just see the place we love, you’ll barrel into it - into our traditions, our riverside garden, our kitchens and our Balinese way of life - taking your own special place around our welcoming table.</p>
        <p>Sure, you’ll learn our coveted recipes and fill your stomach to beyond full, but you’ll go deeper: learning about local Balinese culture, pick your own organic ingredients and get to the heart of cooking, experiencing each intriguing element of everything you’ll put in your mouth.</p>
        <p>And it’s also more fun, when you get below the skin and really go deep.</p>
