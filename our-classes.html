        <h3>Our Cooking Class</h3>
        <h5>Our class menus are a celebration of the freshest ingredients of that season and that day.</h5>
        <p>You will learn recipes found only in a traditional Balinese family compound where the head of the house is a passionate cook such as Adi.</p>
        <p>Start by chopping and pounding spices that you pick from our organic gardens to make Adi’s secret Balinese Spice Paste that he learned as a child from his grandfather and refined as an adult.  With this flavourful spice paste, you'll create authentic ceremonial dishes that are not found anywhere else in Bali.</p>
