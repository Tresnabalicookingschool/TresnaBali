        <h4>Our Cooking School</h4>
        <p>Tresna means "love" in Balinese which is what we've poured into our dream cooking school in Ubud.  It would be a mistake to see us one of the dozen cooking schools in Bali (we're not a restaurant, an afterthought at a hotel or a table set up in someone’s family compound).  We’ve turned the concept of a Balinese cooking class on its head, building it from ground up.  With our shared love of food and cooking, you will delve into hands-on lessons that feature <span class="bold">your hands</span>, not ours.</p>

          <p>Real Balinese food is rather time consuming to prepare but tantalizingly delicious as it’s such a lively, fresh and complex cuisine.  Real Balinese food is rather time consuming to prepare but tantalizingly delicious as it’s such a lively, fresh and complex cuisine.  Visiting tourists who eat Nasi Goreng or Gado Gado are actually sampling dishes from other parts of Indonesia, but these do not represent real Balinese food.</p>
          <p><a href="#">Our Menus</a> are Adi’s own recipes that he’s honed over decades of cooking for loved ones in his family compound and with the village Banjar.  We teach only authentic Balinese Ceremonial dishes as well as home cooked dishes, not found anywhere else in Bali. </p>

          <p>We use the freshest of ingredients such as spices and herbs that <span class="bold">you</span> personally pick from our organic gardens!  We add sashimi quality seafood from Jimbaran Fish Market and choice cuts of pork, free range chickens and organic vegetables that we source at 4:30 am each morning at the local market in Ubud.</p>

        <h4 class="center">Riverside Location</h4>
        <p>We selected the location for its natural riverside tranquility away from the tourist beaches.  We’ve attended cooking schools around Asia and beyond to learn from the best.  We’ve tended our fruit trees for years, planted an organic garden and designed cooking stations that are comfortable and conducive to learning.</p>
        <p>Beyond our beautiful location, we’re systemic in our approach.  Having organized some of the most exclusive weddings on the island, we are applying our event expertise to our passion – authentic Balinese food and traditional living culture.</p>

        <p>We started as a love story 18 years ago.  Frances Tse Ardika, born Canadian and having lived in Hong Kong, London, San Francisco, Tokyo and Toronto as well as having traveled extensively throughout Asia, Europe and the Americas, finally found her paradise and home when she met her Balinese husband, I Made Adi Ardika.  Together, they seek the next big food adventure and discover the foods of their beloved island with friends from near and far.</p>
