        <h3>Tresna Bali</h3>
        <h4>Cooking School</h4>
        <p>Tresna means "love" in Balinese which is what we've poured into the building of our dream cooking school in Ubud.  It would be a mistake to see us as an alternative to the dozen cooking schools in Bali (we are not a restaurant, an after thought at a hotel or a table set up in someone’s family compound).  We’ve turned the concept of a Balinese cooking class on its head, building it from ground up.  With our shared love of food and cooking, you will delve into hands-on lessons that feature <span class="bold">your hands</span>, not ours.</p>

          <h4 class="center">Authentic Balinese Home Cooking</h4>
          <p>Real Balinese food is rather time consuming to prepare but tantalizingly delicious as it’s such a lively, fresh and complex cuisine.  Visiting tourists may be surprised to hear that they are actually sampling dishes from other parts of Indonesia (such as Nasi Goreng or Gado Gado), but these do not originate or represent real Balinese food.</p>
          <p>We teach only authenic Balinese home-cooked dishes as well as extravagant ceremonial specialties such as whole Babi Guling (whole pig roast).  We use the freshest of ingredients from our own gardens and the local market in Ubud.  Our menus are Adi’s own recipes that he’s honed over decades of cooking for loved ones. <a href="#">Our Menus<a> </p>

        <h4 class="center">Riverside Location</h4>
        <p>We selected the location for its natural riverside tranquility away from the tourist beaches.  We’ve attended cooking schools around Asia and beyond to learn from the best.  We’ve tended our fruit trees for years, planted an organic garden and designed cooking stations that are comfortable and conducive to learning.</p>
        <p>Beyond our beautiful location, we’re systemic in our approach.  Having organized some of the most exclusive weddings on the island, we are applying our event expertise to our passion – authentic Balinese food and traditional living culture.</p>

        <p>We started as a love story 16 years ago.  Frances Tse Ardika, born Canadian and having lived in Hong Kong, London, San Francisco, Tokyo and Toronto as well as having traveled extensively throughout Asia, Europe and the Americas, finally found her paradise and home when she met her Balinese husband, I Made Adi Ardika.  Together, they seek the next big food adventure and discover the foods of their beloved island with friends from near and far.</p>
