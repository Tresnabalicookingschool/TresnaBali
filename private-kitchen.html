        <h3>Our Cooking Class</h3>
        <h5>Our class menus are a celebration of the freshest ingredients of that season and that day.</h5>
        <p>You will learn recipes found only in a traditional Balinese family compound where the head of the house is a passionate cook such as Adi.  Start by chopping and pounding spices that you pick from our organic gardens to make Adi’s secret Balinese Spice Paste that he learned as a child from his grandfather and refined as an adult. With your complete spice paste, you will create authentic Balinese dishes using variations of the paste - for example – raw paste to stuff a whole pig to be roasted, lightly sauteed paste for ceremonial pork satay lilit and caramelized paste for fresh urab salad.  </p>
