        <h3>We invite you into our home</h3>
        <h5>Have a hand roasting a whole pig and tear off those first bites of crackling!</h5>
        <p>For our special monthly private kitchen events, come feast on age-old Balinese dishes, not found anywhere with this quality in Bali.  As upmarket event planners, we promise a magical meal with at least 8 mouthwatering dishes to tuck into!  Adi is a Balinese chef focused on his beloved home-cooked food, refined over 28 years of cooking in his family compound.

        <p>Our serious culinary events take days to prepare - you just have to show up and sit down as a guest at our custom built long table for 16 avid food lovers.  We have only 1 event per month - featuring ceremonial foods such as Babi Guling and Satay Lilit that are too time consuming for a hands on class or to replicate at home.
